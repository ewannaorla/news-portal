 A Bangladeshi man was fatally stabbed in New York early on Saturday morning.
Abu Sala Miah, 51, was working as a deliveryman for GrubHub while his family lived in Bangladesh, reports the Daily Mail . <br> <br>


According to a New York Police Department (NYPD) surveillance footage, the attacker, yet to be identified, approached Saleh who was sitting on a park bench at Sarah D. Roosevelt Park in the Lower East Side.
The hooded man tried to steal Sala’s e-bike, leading to a struggle after which he slashed his face and stabbed him in the stomach, the footage shows. <br> <br>


According to the police, Salah ran back toward the park as he bled out, seeking the help of a Parks Department employee.

He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, police said.

The Daily News, citing family members, reported that Miah had borrowed money from a friend to buy the e-bike and would often rest at the park before heading to a nearby apartment that he shared with roommates. <br> <br>


His roommates reportedly tracked him down at the hospital when they grew concerned about Saleh when he didn't return home Saturday night.

According to the victim’s brother-in-law Muhammad Ahsan, 44, Salah had emigrated to the United States out of fear of political prosecution two years ago.

'He came to this country two years ago for a better life ... He just always had that dream to move here,' said Ahsan.

Salah worked hard to send money back home to his wife, 19-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son, he said.
